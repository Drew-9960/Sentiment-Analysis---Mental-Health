## Mental Health NLP (Sentiment Analysis)

### Project Overview

This project aims to classify mental health statements into various categories such as Anxiety, Bipolar, Depression, Normal, Personality Disorder, Stress, and Suicidal using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a model that can effectively analyze text data and provide insights into the mental health status of individuals based on their statements.

### Motivation

Mental health is a crucial aspect of overall well-being, and understanding the mental health status of individuals can help in providing timely and appropriate support. This project leverages NLP to analyze textual data and identify mental health conditions, which can be beneficial for mental health professionals, researchers, and organizations working in the field of mental health.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of statements related to mental health along with their corresponding status labels. The dataset includes various mental health conditions such as Anxiety, Bipolar, Depression, Normal, Personality Disorder, Stress, and Suicidal. The data is used to train and evaluate machine learning models for sentiment analysis.

### Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to remove noise and irrelevant information.
   - Text data is normalized by converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, stopwords, and special characters.
   - Data augmentation techniques are applied to enhance the dataset.

2. **Text Vectorization:**
   - The cleaned text data is transformed into numerical representations using techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

3. **Model Training:**
   - Machine learning models, particularly Logistic Regression, are trained on the vectorized text data.
   - Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model performance.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - The trained model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Confusion matrix and classification reports are generated to assess the model's performance.

5. **Feature Importance:**
   - The importance of different features (words) in predicting mental health status is analyzed and visualized.

### Results

The project successfully classifies mental health statements with a high level of accuracy. The model demonstrates strong performance across multiple mental health categories, providing valuable insights into the mental health status of individuals based on their statements. Key findings include:

- The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 87%.
- The classification report indicates high precision and recall for most categories.
- The confusion matrix highlights the model's ability to distinguish between different mental health conditions effectively.

### Applications

This project has several potential applications, including:

- **Mental Health Support:** Assisting mental health professionals in identifying and categorizing mental health conditions based on patient statements.
- **Research:** Providing researchers with tools to analyze large datasets of textual data related to mental health.
- **Awareness:** Raising awareness about mental health conditions and the importance of timely intervention.

### Future Work

Future enhancements to this project could include:

- Expanding the dataset to include more diverse and comprehensive statements.
- Exploring additional machine learning models and NLP techniques for improved accuracy.
- Developing a real-time application for mental health sentiment analysis.
- Integrating the model with mental health support platforms for practical deployment.

### Conclusion

The Mental Health NLP project demonstrates the potential of using NLP and machine learning to analyze and classify mental health statements. By leveraging advanced techniques, this project aims to contribute to the field of mental health by providing valuable insights and tools for mental health professionals and researchers.
